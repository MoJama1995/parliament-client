This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Notes Mohamed Jama

I decided to write the application in React.js, with some styling by importing the Semantic Ui Library.

In order to run the project, run NPM install in your terminal in order to create the node modules.
To start the project, run NPM start.

A Few Notes:

Due to time constraints

- I was never able to create a Mock API that would send a payload to an endpoint.
- Implement any behaviour testing - there are a few points I would like to have tested and approached differently, from a TDD perspective.

Other points that have not been completed:

- Could not get the correct image unfortunately. Due to a CORS Error I had no access through my browser.
